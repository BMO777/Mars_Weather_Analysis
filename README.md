# Mars_Weather_Analysis

In the Jupyter Notebook part 1, the python libraries, beautiful soup 4, selenium and splinter are used to scrape data from:
(https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) 
It loops though the title and the article teaser making a dictionary and wraps it in a list to display...useful for turning it into a dataframe if one so desires.

In the Jupyter notebook with part 2 in the title, the same python libraries are used as the one with part one, but pandas is added to display the data in a table scraped from:
(https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) in dataframe format.

This table data about Mars is then used to answer the followind queries, though more may be asked and answered by the data:

    -How many months exist on Mars?
    -How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    -What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 
    -Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 
    -About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
